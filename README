0. GENERAL PREFACE

    For most of the general details regarding our "OCo" project collection and
our company at large, visit <https://github.com/arqadium/oco-engine#readme>.
This document specifically covers important details regarding the OCo Working
Set Toolchain.



1. INTRODUCTION

    General-purpose toolchains are built to solve general problems, and it's
not uncommon for teams and companies to face unique challenges that few or no
people have dealt with, leaving them on their own to solve those problems.
With that in mind, we are dedicating a repository ahead-of-time to extending
the functionality of general purpose software suites such as Visual Studio and
the GNU toolchain for our own purposes. All of our build scripts (written in
Python) reside here alongside their dependencies, and we intend to build other
types of command-line programs for other tasks such as testing and deployment.



2. WHY OUR TOOLCHAIN IS FOSS

    One may ask, "Your OCo Engine is FOSS, but you know how to monetise it.
How do you plan to collect ROI from a sister project like this?" To answer
this, it's important to look at the bigger picture comprising what we're
building: a video game. As far as our bottom line goes, we save ourselves
money while still collecting ROI by making Free Software - this is not limited
to the things immediate to the game itself. After all, you'll probably need
these things to build the engine anyway! There are of course the benefits of
crowd-sourcing and the public eye on bug reporting that would be out-of-reach
in a closed environment.
